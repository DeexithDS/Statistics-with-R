##ANSWER 1H

#A and B
#A->[58.21601,59.78399] ,B->[58.34206 59.65794]
#Since we need only 90% confidence interval, the lower limit increases and moves closer to mean and the upper limit drecreases and moves closer towards the mean. The confidence interval becomes smaller since we are decreasing the certainity from 0.95 to 0.90. The tails of distribution become bigger, leaving 0.05 on each side.

#A and C
#A->[58.21601,59.78399, Difference=1.56] ,C->[57.96967 60.03033, Difference=2.06]
#The confidence interval becomes bigger since we are increasing the certainity from 0.95 to 0.99. Hence the difference between the upper and lower limit increase from 1.56 to 2.06. THe tails become smaller from 0.025 to 0.001 on each side.

#A and D
#A->[58.21601,59.78399, Difference=1.56] ,D->[ 57.43203, 60.56797 Difference=3.13]
#Here the sample size is reduced from 100 to 25. As sample size reduces, the distribution tends to be deviating from normal distribution shape, with the values being farther from the mean. As more values get away from the mean, the range of values (interval) increases and the difference between limits increases, for same confidence.

#A and E
#A->[58.21601,59.78399, Difference=1.56] ,E->[ 58.60801, 59.391997 Difference=-0.783]
#Here the sample size is reduced increased from 100 to 400.As sample size increase, the distribution tends to be closer to normal distribution, with the values being closer to the mean. As more values get closer to the mean, the range of value (interval) shrinks and the limits become smaller, for same confidence.

#A and F
#A->[58.21601,59.78399, Difference=1.56] ,F->[ 58.804, 59.196 Difference=-0.391]
#As standard deviation decreases, the error decreases.

#Mean Limits = Population mean +/- (Crtical Value*Population Standard Deviation/sqrt(sample size))

#Hence, from the above formula, we can see that when the sample standard deviation decreases, the error decreases. This in turn leads to decrease in the difference between the limits. Also, as error decreases, the interval range is smaller for same confidence.

#A and G
#A->[58.21601,59.78399, Difference=1.56] ,G->[ 55.864,62.135 Difference=6.271]
#As standard deviation increases, the error increases.

#Mean Limits = Population mean +/- (Crtical Value*Population Standard Deviation/sqrt(sample size))

#Hence, from the above formula, we can see that when the sample standard deviation increases, the error increases. This in turn leads to increase in the difference between the limits. Also, as error increases, the interval range is bigger for same confidence.

#When we increased the sample size from n=10 (SD=4848.94) to n=30 (SD=8897.84), the SD increased and is closer to the population SD of 10000.

#Hence, this shows that increase in the number of samples of same sample size makes the samples to behave more like sample parameters. But increasing the sample size makes the sample behave more closer to the population.
