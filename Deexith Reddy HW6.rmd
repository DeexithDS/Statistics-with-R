#ANSWER 1

##ANSWER 1A
#4. A risk-averse person would always prefer a greater, non-guaranteed reward to a lesser,
#but guaranteed reward. 
#A risk-averse person will check for the stock with lesser risk and guaranteed reward. Hence, less volatility and higher expected return with lesser spread.
```


```{r}

##ANSWER 1B
#2. Small-cap stocks

```

```{r}
##ANSWER 1C
#3. Treasury bonds have earned a higher return than corporate bonds. Treasury bonds and bills have lesser return than equity.

```

```{r}
##ANSWER 1D
#3. The one with a greater variance of returns. Variance of return is imortant as greater variance, greater is the risk. This effect is more than the other mentioned choices.
```


```{r}
##ANSWER 1E
# C AND B are not dominated by any other stock.

#C is dominant over E since it has lesser standard deviation and risk with same expected value or return.
#C is dominant over D since it has same standard deviation but more expected value or return.
#Therefore, D and E are eliminated.

#B has lesser risk/standard deviation and more expected value/return. Hence, B is dominant over A.
#A is eliminated.

#We cannot quantify and conclude which is dominant between B and C from the figure.

#Let X be standard deviation of market index

##ANSWER 1L
#2 is incorrect. A correlation coefficient of 1 does not necessarily mean beta is 1. It depends on the ratio of standard deviations. More standard deviation in stock than market, greater is beta. If standard deviation of stock is less than market, beta will be lower.
```

```{r}
##ANSWER 1m
#2 is incorrect.When we substitute in the combined standard deviation formula, the combined standard deviation will be equal to weighted average only when the two stocks are perfectly correlated.

#sd(R1,R2)=((x1*sd(R1))^2 + (x1*sd(R1))^2 + 2*x1*x2*P*sd(R1)*sd(R2))^0.5, where P is correlation coefficiect

#For uncorrelated, P=0, sd(R1,R2)=((x1*sd(R1))^2 + (x1*sd(R1))^2)^0.5
#For perfectly correlated, P=1, sd(R1,R2)=((x1*sd(R1))^2 + (x1*sd(R1))^2 + 2*x1*x2*sd(R1)*sd(R2) )^0.5 = x1*sd(R1) + x2*sd(R2),
#                                                                                                        by a^2 + b^2 + 2*a*b = (a+b)^2
